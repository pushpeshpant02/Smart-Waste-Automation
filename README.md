# Smart Waste Automation 🚮🔋

An AI-driven, sensor-based smart waste management system designed to **monitor**, **segregate**, and **manage waste automatically**, reducing manual effort and promoting sustainability.

---

## 🔧 Features

- 📏 **Real-time waste level detection** using ultrasonic sensors  
- 🔄 **Automated segregation** of wet and dry waste using servo-controlled bins  
- 🔔 **Smart notifications** when bins are full or near capacity  
- ⚡ **Energy-efficient** design with low power consumption  
- 🌐 **IoT-enabled** monitoring via Wi-Fi (ESP8266/NodeMCU)  
- 🧼 **Cleaner, more hygienic** urban and residential environments
